# Graduation-project
This is my senior project (2021-2022)

It consists of a smart online monitoring systems that will be used with online lectures along side of existing educational platforms such as zoom and google meets.

It will have a student side server that handles all the complex calculations such as face and iris detection and hand detection and calculating the percentage of the students concentration and engagement in the lesson.

The teacher side server will have 2 main functions :
    1-Give un-intrusive notifications to the teacher if most of the class is not engaged.
    2-Take attendance and store it as an excel sheet locally on the teachers computer.
